  <h2>Raaid Tanveer</h2>

  <p>Graduated from Carnegie Mellon University's <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu">School of Computer Science</a>.
    I concentrated in Algorithms and Complexity, and focused my studies on complexity theory, compilers,
    probability theory, graphics, generative artificial intelligence and many more areas which seemed interesting at the
    time.
    <br>
    <br>
    During my undergraduate years, I was a teaching assistant to the following courses:
  <ul>
    <li>15-251 Great Ideas in Theoretical Computer Science (S22, F22)</li>
    <li>15-259 Probability in Computing (S23)</li>
    <li>15-451 Algorithm Design and Analysis (F23)</li>
  </ul>
  Currently, I'm building <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>'s internal billing system and
  subscriptions offerings for Stripe products.

  I'm trying to learn WebGPU. You'll find some animation that makes use of WebGPU down below on this website.
  Ultimately, I want to
  implement a ray-tracer with some cool textures on the cube, but so far this is what I have. Stay tuned!
